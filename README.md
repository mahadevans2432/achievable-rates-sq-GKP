# Achievable rates for concatenated square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes
This repository hosts the source code and data accompanying the preprint 	[arXiv:2505.10499 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10499v1).

The source code to generate all the data in Figures 1(c), 2(a), 2(c), 10(a), and 10(b) can be found in all_plots.ipynb jupyter notebook. The remaining plots use data generated through monte-carlo simulations using functions defined in monte_carlo_funcs.py (methods described in manuscript). All data generated through this method is for estimation of Bhattachary parameters and is contained in the folders Zdata and Zdata_alpha.
